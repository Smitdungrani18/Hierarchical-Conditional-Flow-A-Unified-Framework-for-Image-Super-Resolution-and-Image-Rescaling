# Hierarchical-Conditional-Flow-A-Unified-Framework-for-Image-Super-Resolution-and-Image-Rescaling

This project delves into the innovative realm of image processing, particularly
focusing on image super-resolution and rescaling, as conceptualized in the
"Hierarchical Conditional Flow: A Unified Framework for Image Super-Resolution
and Image Rescaling" paper. The paper introduces a novel framework, Hierarchical
Conditional Flow (HCFlow), which uniquely integrates the tasks of
super-resolution and image rescaling into a cohesive process. Our project aims to
explore and implement this cutting-edge approach, seeking to enhance the quality
and versatility of image processing techniques.
